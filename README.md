# Ragdoll-Controller
Editor tool that simplifies ragdoll creation &amp; usage

Often when it's necessary for meshes rigged with means such as Mixamo to have ragdolls implemented, we need to use Unity's Ragdoll Wizard. However this is a tedious,
time-consuming and thanks to the naming convention of these means, completely unnecessary. Using this tool, adding or removing a ragdoll can be done with the press of a
button.

The asset also provides a simple way to enable or disable ragdolls, push ragdolls around, and other features designed to simplify tasks related to ragdolls
